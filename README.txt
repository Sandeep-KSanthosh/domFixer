In this folder you will find two HTML files. One is "start.html" and the other
is “goal.html”. Open and look at the goal file. Also take a look at the start
file. You must make the HTML in the start HTML structurally equivalent (the same
as) the goal HTML. You must do this using JavaScript to alter the DOM only. You
cannot modify any of the HTML. You do not need to modify any CSS. Write only in
the JavaScript file. When you are done, look at the generated HTML using the
browser's developer tools. Compare this to the goal file. If the two are the
same, you are done. Note that HTML doesn't care about white-space or attribute
order. That is why I say that the start HTML code needs to be  structurally
equivalent to the end HTML after the JavaScript program has run. You don't need
to worry about applying styles. If you get HTML structure (elements, classes,
and ids) to be correct, the styles will apply properly.

Note that the start.html page has a script tag at the very bottom. You do not
need to add or remove this from the goal file.
